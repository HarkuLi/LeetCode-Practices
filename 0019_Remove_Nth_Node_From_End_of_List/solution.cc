/**
 * Idea:
 * 1. Index of the target to be removed is `size - n`.
 * 2. Use a pointer as an end probe, and forward it for `n` times.
 * 3. If `n == size`, the end probe will be nullptr now. Then, we can remove
 *    the head and return the next node of original head as the new head.
 * 4. Else, forward the end probe and target pointer together until the end
 *    probe arrives the end (= nullptr), and the target pointer will point to
 *    the node to be removed. Totally, the end probe was moved `size` times, and
 *    the target pointer was moved `size - n` times.
 *
 * Time Complexity: Î˜(n), where n is the size of input list
 * Space Complexity: Î˜(1)
